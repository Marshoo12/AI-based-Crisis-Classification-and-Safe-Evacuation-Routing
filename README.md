# AI-based-Crisis-Classification-and-Safe-Evacuation-Routing
This project integrates AI for real-time crisis detection and adaptive evacuation routing using Twitter data. NLP and ML classify crisis types and intensity, while a dynamic A* (D*) algorithm computes optimal, continuously updated safe routes to shelters, enhancing rapid awareness and real-time evacuation decisions.
