# AI-based-Crisis-Classification-and-Safe-Evacuation-Routing
This project integrates AI for real-time crisis detection and adaptive evacuation routing using Twitter data. NLP and ML classify crisis types and intensity, while a dynamic A* (D*) algorithm computes optimal, continuously updated safe routes to shelters, enhancing rapid awareness and real-time evacuation decisions.

It presents an integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for real-time crisis detection and adaptive evacuation routing. The system leverages textual data collected from Twitter to identify potential crisis situations such as floods, earthquakes, or accidents, and then computes an optimal safe evacuation route using a dynamic variant of the A* pathfinding algorithm. The crisis classification model employs natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to interpret social media data and categorize tweets based on crisis intensity and type. Upon detecting a crisis, a dynamic A* (D*) algorithm is applied to simulate route planning in a grid-based environment, continuously updating the safest path toward designated shelter points as conditions evolve. The proposed framework enables rapid crisis awareness and adaptive navigation support, bridging the gap between event detection and real-time decision-making for safe evacuation.
